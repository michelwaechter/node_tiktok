## 🥁 _TikTok Data Wrapper 2022_ 🥁

Tiktokify is a lightweigth package for fetching data out of tiktoks public api. At this 
moment you only can fetch data from any user, but in near future you will have the possibility also to fetch clips and other stuff

## 🥁 Motivation

TikTok is acutally one of the most important social networks in the whole world. All Packages aren't up to date, buggy or weren't maintained anymore. At this point I started to develope an own solution. Lightweigth and focused on the basic things.
